# Windows

Use **`flash.ps1`** — `flash.sh` is a bash script and will not run natively.
Every command in [the README](../README.md) works the same way; only the leading
`.\` differs. If you prefer bash, `flash.sh` runs in **Git Bash**, which uses the
Windows Python and the Windows network. **WSL2 is not suitable for `unlock` or
`backup`** by default; see [WSL and Git Bash](#wsl-and-git-bash).

## One-time setup

1. **Python 3**

   ```powershell
   winget install Python.Python.3.12
   ```

   Tick *Add python.exe to PATH* if the installer offers it, then reopen
   PowerShell.

   If `python` prints *Python was not found* from the Microsoft Store, Python is
   installed but the Store's `python.exe` / `python3.exe` **App execution aliases**
   are shadowing it. Turn both off in **Settings → Apps → Advanced app settings →
   App execution aliases**, or just let the tool use the `py` launcher, which it
   prefers automatically.

2. **OpenSSH Client**

   Check with `ssh -V`. If it is unrecognised, open PowerShell **as administrator**
   and run:

   ```powershell
   Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name OpenSSH.Client~~~~0.0.1.0
   ```

## Running the tool

```powershell
.\flash.ps1 check      # read-only compatibility check
.\flash.ps1 backup --key $HOME\.ssh\idu_rsa   # unlock + backup
```

Create the key first, as shown in [There is no `expect` on
Windows](#there-is-no-expect-on-windows); `backup` needs it to verify the login.

The leading `.\` is required — PowerShell does not run scripts from the current
folder by name alone.

If it reports *running scripts is disabled on this system*, permit scripts for the
current window only and retry:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass
```

This expires when the window closes and changes nothing permanently.

## There is no `expect` on Windows

The unlock leaves root passwordless. Signing in to that account automatically is
driven by `expect` on macOS and Linux, and Windows has no `expect` — so any step
that needs a *scripted* SSH login (`backup`, and the persistence check) requires a
key. Create one once and pass it:

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048 -f $HOME\.ssh\idu_rsa
.\flash.ps1 backup --key $HOME\.ssh\idu_rsa
```

Use RSA: the stock Dropbear on these units rejects Ed25519.

On Windows, pass the key to `unlock` as well. The web-API injection itself needs
no key, but the persistence check is a scripted SSH login: without a key,
`unlock` can enable SSH and still report failure. Passing `--key` also installs
the public key on the router.

## Firewall and port 80

To unlock, the tool starts a small web server on your PC that the *router*
downloads the installer from. On the first unlock, Windows Firewall will ask for
permission — click **Allow** for **Private** networks (your home network;
*Public* is for cafés and similar).

If an unlock ends with *the router did not call back*, allow `python.exe` through
the firewall, or run PowerShell as administrator so the rule can be created.

If it says `cannot listen on port 80: permission denied`, run PowerShell as
Administrator and retry. If it says `already in use`, another program owns the
port — IIS and the *World Wide Web Publishing Service* are common holders:

```powershell
netstat -ano | findstr :80
```

A reboot clears a stuck holder.

The tool prints the address it expects the router to call:

```text
[*] Callback: http://192.168.31.51:80/ (the router fetches the installer here)
```

If that is not your LAN address (a VPN, Hyper-V or a second adapter can win the
route), pass the correct one:

```powershell
.\flash.ps1 --address 192.168.31.51 unlock
```

## WSL and Git Bash

**Git Bash** runs the Windows Python, so `flash.sh` works there normally.

**WSL2** is different. Its default NAT puts the distribution on a private
`172.16.0.0/12` network (`172.16`–`172.31`), while the router is on the Windows
LAN. The router cannot dial into the VM. When the router is outside that range,
`unlock` rejects the address before it starts the callback server, instead of
waiting for a callback that cannot arrive. Running as root inside WSL does not
fix the route. Use `flash.ps1` natively for `unlock` and `backup`. `detect` and
`check` are fine in WSL because they only make outbound requests.

If you need WSL2, enable mirrored networking in `%UserProfile%\.wslconfig`:

```ini
[wsl2]
networkingMode=mirrored
```

Then run `wsl --shutdown`, reopen the distribution, and allow Python through
Windows Firewall. A port proxy plus `--address` with the Windows LAN address also
works, but has more moving parts.

## Single-dash options

PowerShell users can use single-dash forms (`-Router`, `-Password`, `-Key`,
`-Address`, `-Force` instead of `--router`, `--password`, `--key`, `--address`,
`--force`).
